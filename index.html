        <h3 id="#what-is-a-service">What is a service?</h3>
        <p>A <i>service</i> is something that helps people to do something - for example to complete a task, meet a goal, or achieve an outcome.
          <br> Whether it’s a narrow transaction, like paying car tax, or a public service like _education_, at its core every service is a value exchange between service user and service provider.
          <br> In Government, service teams are moving away from thinking about services as narrow transactions, towards understanding _end-to-end_ how public services delivered desired outcomes for service users. In this context, examples of whole
          services might be “becoming a teacher” or “paying for university” or “setting up an academy”. A service should be whatever a user needs to fully achieve those outcomes - even if parts of that service journey lie beyond the control of the
          service team.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3 id="#what-is-a-service-made-of">What is a service made of?</h3>
        <ul>A <i>whole service</i> includes everything involved in achieving the users’ desired outcome
          <li>from people, provider partnerships and processes to the underlying technology and data used</li>
          <li>everything a user does, from finding out what to do, choosing to do it, and working within the rules</li>
          <li>all interactions and touchpoints regardless of channel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> A _whole service_ solves a _whole problem_ for its users. This concept is much broader than many of the things we currently call services - which might better be described as sub-services or partial services. </p>
        <ul>Examples of these include:
          <li>major steps and stages (e.g. apply, re-qualify)</li>
          <li>activities that users and providers are doing (e.g. finding information, checking information)</li>
          <li>business capabilities (e.g. managing financial allocations, data visualisation).</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>This intentionally broad definition of _service_ pushes teams to understand how they contribute to the delivery of their users’ goals. It challenges teams to engage with unreliable outsourced sub-services, to consider duplicate data
          burdens,
          to track and measure real world impact beyond service requests and registrations. It asks them to coordinate across the systems, teams and organisations that exist in each stage of the whole service they’re designing for. Only by working
          this way can they escape Conway’s Law and deliver the seamless, consistent, effective services that their users deserve. </p>
