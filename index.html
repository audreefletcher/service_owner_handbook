<a id="#what-is-a-service">What is a service?</a>
    <p>A <i>service</i> is something that helps people to do something - for example to complete a task, meet a goal, or achieve an outcome.
      <br> Whether it’s a narrow transaction, like paying car tax, or a public service like _education_, at its core every service is a value exchange between service user and service provider.
      <br> In Government, service teams are moving away from thinking about services as narrow transactions, towards understanding _end-to-end_ how public services delivered desired outcomes for service users. In this context, examples of whole services might be “becoming a teacher” or “paying for university” or “setting up an academy”. A service should be whatever a user needs to fully achieve those outcomes - even if parts of that service journey lie beyond the control of the service team.
