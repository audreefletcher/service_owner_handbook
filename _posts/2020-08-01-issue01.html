<h2><a href="https://blog.mattedgar.com/2015/01/23/the-last-target-operating-model-youll-ever-need/">The last Target Operating Model you'll ever need</a></h2>

<p>Short, thought-provoking blog post from one of the architects of NHS Digital's transformation, about how well Target Operating Models fit (or don't fit) with agile ways of working.</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/18F/technology-budgeting/blob/master/handbook.md">De-risking custom technology projects in government</a></h2>

<p>A stonkingly good guide written by the US Government's equivalent of GDS to guide states in their technology decision-making. Highly recommend - look out especially for their key questions and checklists. Procurement advice gold, so please don't be put off by the fact it's in Github.</p>

<h2><a href="https://catalogue.projectsbyif.com/">IF's Data Patterns catalogue"</a></h2>

<p>The team at ProjectsbyIF have curated a really great catalogue to help teams make decisions about how, when and why to collect and use data about people. If your teams are thinking about user data, consent, permissions and the like (and I hope they are), then take a gander at this gem.</p>
