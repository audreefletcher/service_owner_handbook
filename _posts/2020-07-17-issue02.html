<h2><a href="https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2020/06/11/exploration-over-pre-discovery/">Exploration over prediscovery</a></h2>

<p>An excellent blog post from Scott Colfer on “what should happen before a discovery”. It’s worth taking the time to think about – after all, the questions you ask determine the answers you get.</p>

<h2><a href="https://openpolicy.blog.gov.uk/2020/03/06/introducing-a-government-as-a-system-toolkit/">Government as a system</a></h2>

<p>An excellent piece of work from Andrea Siodmok at the PolicyLab - showing the breadth of intervention options available to us when we take a systems leadership position. Also - though Andrea has recently departed, her PolicyLab team will be joining us here in DfE very soon, so I’m expecting our community to benefit much more from this type of thinking over the coming months and years.</p>

<h2><a href="https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/02/an-introduction-to-wardley-value-chain.html">Wardley Mapping</a></h2>

<p>Considered a seminal piece of work on digital transformation, Simon Wardley’s work is a must-read. Start with his value chain mapping (or “Wardley mapping”) to get your teeth into how to unpick build/buy/rent decisions for services. Ask yourself why you’re custom-building a kettle (if you are). And then move onto his works on “universal principles” and “pioneers, settlers and town planners”. It’s all really thought provoking and highly usable.</p>
