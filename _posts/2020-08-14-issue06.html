<p>Failing to properly budget for live services is a widespread problem across government. Partly because people don't have good mental models for what happens in live; and partly because of the funding classification chasm we have to cross when transitioning from Public Beta.

<p>I know as a department we're not especially into AI yet (most areas have lots of data housekeeping still to do before they can do anything clever, though as Eileen showed, there are trailblazers). But I thought you might want to start to get your head into what it means to design for AI - it feels timely given this Cabinet Office automation review, and the known preoccupations within Number 10. So here's nice little primer from IBM's AI design studio - with a free and well-reviewed course available to anyone who wants to dive in a little deeper. </p>
