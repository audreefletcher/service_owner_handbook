<h2><a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/web-check">NCSC's cybersecurity webcheck service</a></h2>

<p>Really useful tool for checking your services for common cyber vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. You can sign in, set up a watchlist for your service URLs, and get notified if any of them are or become non-compliant. The warnings they give are categories as URGENT, ADVISORY and INFORMATIONAL. It's super easy to set up so there's not much of an excuse for any of us to not be using it. You just need to put the right URLs in - including any domains that send emails (if theyâ€™re not GOV.UK Notify). Ask your devs or TA for help if you're not sure.</p>

<p>My go-to signposting for any colleagues who aren't quite sure who is responsible for the accessibility of their service. The answer is always - spoiler - everyone. This guide walks through what you should expect to see the different roles in your multidisciplinary teams doing, if they're nailing the accessibility challenge for you.</p>

<h2><a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/resources-and-tools/">Sharing across government</a></h2>

<p>This is a development I'm excited to finally see -  the sharing of resources, tools and common components across government, including a Rails boilerplate for GOV.UK Frontend from within our very own DfE community. This approach has got to be the future of designing and building in-house services cost-effectively - and I know it's something that Rosie and Luke are eager to support this community with. Watch this space.</p>
