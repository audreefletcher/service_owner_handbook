<h2><a href="https://medium.com/@stephen.gill/failure-demand-a-definition-471d9c99b81e">Failure demand</a></h2>

<p>A nice little blog post from Stephen Gill looking at failure demand as applied to public digital services. Highly recommended, because failure demand is something I don't think we give enough thought to as a department. If you want to go a bit deeper, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24t4xYW6lr0&feature=youtu.be">here's a webinar</a> from the most prominent thinker on failure demand, John Seddon.</p>

<h2><a href="https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2015/02/18/knocking-down-the-towers-of-siam/">Multisourcing</a></h2>

<p>Essentially extending the logic of Simon Wardley - who looked at maturity of technologies to inform decisions about build/re-use/rent/buy - into sourcing strategy. Alex Holmes talks about moving away from binary choices and one-size-fits-all methods that rely heavily on systems integration. Pair this article with <a href="https://cabinetofficetechnology.blog.gov.uk/2015/02/12/choosing-technology-that-is-at-least-as-good-as-people-have-at-home/">one from MOJ CDIO Tom Read</a> who lays out their step-by-step process for working through sourcing decisions.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2017/11/06/Alpha-to-Live-is-not-a-linear-progression-f38e49f5a52f/">Alpha to live is not a linear progression</a></h2>

<p>The linearity suggested in GDS diagrams showing Discovery>Alpha>Beta>Live is frustratingly misleading - indeed, as with most models, following it unquestioningly causes some serious problems and missed opportunities. Michael Brunton-Spall in this article lays out some of the thinking to avoid in this article - with particularly great challenges around the role of alpha, and the observation that, if you're truly prototyping lots of different ideas, you should think of them as separate alphas, expect a much higher failure rate, and plan to throw away your alpha code before progressing anything into beta. MBS then follows it up with a corker of an article <a href="https://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2018/12/09/Discovery-Alpha-Beta-Live-Part-2-cb7bb844d140/">here</a> describing them instead by their intent and so dividing things into discovery, prototyping, MVP, build and live, spelling out how different each phase is from the next.</p>
