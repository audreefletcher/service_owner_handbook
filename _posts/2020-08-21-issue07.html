<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/GRYbPWxrv34">MoJ Formbuilder quick demo video</a></h2>
<p>Listen to Himal as he walks you quickly through the new MoJ Formbuilder. He describes it as Google Forms on steroids producing code fully compliant with service standards - meaning teams can build these without devs on the team</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.platformland.org/">Welcome to Platformland</a></h2>
<p>Government Digital veteran Richard Pope, whilst on a jaunt to Harvard, looked at platforms in Government - and Government as a Platform - around the world. To share his learning, he created and curated this magnificent collection of resources for peopâ€‹le just like you. We're bookmarking that definitions page and hoping to tighten up our language a bit - going over SR bids we're seeing more "platform" than a game of SuperMarioBros.</p>

<h2><a href="https://bat-design-history.netlify.app/">Design Histories</a></h2>
<p>We're huge fans of design histories like these so we thought I'd share an example with you today - the one built by the Becoming A Teacher team. Design histories are important for knowledge management - showing and evidencing design decisions that have been made. They're good for communication - telling the story of your service as it is evolving. They're good for audit and archive - because they're connected to either actual code or real screenshots and so are a means of navigating "the public record" of what was, needed for accountability. And the latter is becoming increasingly important - we're expecting significant pressure for us to become more open in our designs and code over the coming year. Anyway, take a look, see what you think. The code is, of course, open and cloneable on Github.</p>
